                Meet Dhanam, the Code Whisperer 😎💻
<br><br>
Hey there! I’m Dhanam, a 2nd-year college student with a love for coding that’s stronger than my love for my girlfriend😜 (sorry babe just kidding😉). After a one-month coding detox—which wasn’t by choice, by the way, life just happened 🤷‍♂️—I decided to dive back into the wonderful world of brackets, bugs 🐛, and late-night debugging sessions 🕒.
<br><br>
To shake off the rust 🛠️, I created this project as my “warm-up act.” Think of it as my comeback tour 🎸, but with fewer guitar solos and more console.logs. Why? Because coding is fun 🎉, and if you’re not laughing at your own code (or crying 🥲, depending on the day), you’re doing it wrong.
<br><br>
Oh, and did I mention there are memes sprinkled around here? 😏 Yes, Easter eggs for the tech-savvy 🥚🐇, because what’s a website without a dash of humour and a pinch of chaos?
<br><br>
Feel free to stalk😏—uh, I mean, follow—me🤪 on LinkedIn 🌐, X (formerly Twitter, because rebrands, amirite? 🐦), and GitHub 🐙 for more projects, ideas, and possibly more memes. Who knows? You might even find something useful! 🤯
<br><br>
Cheers,<br>
Dhanam (your friendly neighbourhood code enthusiast 🕸️✨)
